# STM32CubeMX and adafruit_GFX
STM32CubeMX and adadfruit_GFX for TFT display.  
In this example I used ILI9341 (ST7789) driver with TFT display with a resolution of 320x240.  
The interfaces are 8-bit parallel.
The origin software is a arduino example from MCUFRIEND_kbv.
MCUFRIEND_kbv uses the adafruit_GFX for his own displays.
I transfer the software in IDE SW4STM32 (Eclipse) with STM32CubeMX.
In this way I can see what happens.
